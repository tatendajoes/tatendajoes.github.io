This week mainly consisted of wrapping up the long-implemented work of the summer. Activities included writing reports, handing over equipment and tools, and discussing future work and opportunities with mentors. 

I got to present my work for the summer at the End of Summer Presentations. I also received my certificate, played games, and had fun for the last time with my teammates.
