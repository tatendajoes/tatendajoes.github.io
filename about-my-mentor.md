## About My Mentor

My mentor, David Nyarko, has extensive experience collaborating with Dr. Kofi Nyarko on projects focusing on robot autonomy and deep learning.

- He has been instrumental in developing and maintaining the edge-tpu-sliva library, which improves upon the Raspberry Pi Coral TPU USB Accelerator's performance for robotics and deep learning.
- Nyarko's background in machine learning, computer vision segmentation, and classification, especially in real-time segmentation for automated navigation, sets him apart as a mentor and innovator in the field.
