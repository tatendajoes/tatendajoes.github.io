This week involved understanding the basics of the technologies that will be used throughout the research process. I explored Libraries like OpenCV and Yolo. I also set up the Raspberry Pi.
I did not encounter any major problems this week. I had a vast compass of resources, including my peers, my mentors, and the internet, which made the work easy. 
I achieved all the tasks for the week, including detecting a black line on a piece of paper using OpenCV, Booting a Raspbian OS on the Raspberry Pi, and using one of Yolo's segmentation models to perform object detection and segmentation
