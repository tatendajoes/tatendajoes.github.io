During the first week, I participated in a boot camp orientation. I engaged in activities that included;
* Meeting with Graduate Student Research mentor
* Taking a Python Placement Test
* Taking a Python 102 class
* Taking a Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit Learn class
* Designing my project website using GitHub

Results included learning new skills and developing my first AI model using logistic regression and random forest classifier. I found out that I still had something to learn even though some classes were basic and also that my classmates were brilliant, considering that some of them had no coding background but were still doing immensely well.
