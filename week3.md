Teams were divided into two: one working on the SLAM-based implementation and another on the track-based implementation. I worked on the track-based implementation system, and for the week, I completed the required task: to train the first version of an objection detection model to be used on the track-based implementation. 

I trained my model on the yolov8 model. I used Roboflow as the annotation tool and trained my model using Google Colab.
