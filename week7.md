The achievements for this week include:
- Participated in the Mid-Summer Presentations. 
- Modifying the segmentation method so that it can track the direction of the track. 

Challenges included dealing with unknown physical variables and constraints. Because of that, next week, I will start testing and debugging the code on the wheelchair itself.
