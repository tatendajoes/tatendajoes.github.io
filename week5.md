- Implemented segmentation model on Raspberry Pi; performance was drastically inefficient.
- The segmentation model was exported to a .tflite format compatible with the coral USB accelerator. 
- Implemented the edge tpu compatible version of the model and compared performance with precious benchmarks.  
- Wrote Python code to read and capture QR codes, an implementation required for the autonomous wheelchair.
